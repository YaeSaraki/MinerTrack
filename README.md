## MinerTrack Anti-XRay

**MinerTrack** is a plugin that will really help you catch those naughty players using Xray on your server in a **different way** from other Anti-Xray plugins. This plugin doesn't hide ores, as hiding ores requires a lot of resources.

*So how does it work?*

To catch Xray, MinerTrack uses an **advanced algorithm** that combines **several factors** like ore scarcity, the amount of ores mined in a certain period, the player’s path to ores, and many other aspects.

*But can't people still use Xray?*

Yes and no. Indeed, a player using Xray has two options:
1. Keep using Xray but behave like a normal player to avoid being caught. They can't get more ores than a normal player or they’ll be caught by MinerTrack.
2. Uninstall their Xray or be caught.

*Why choose MinerTrack over other AntiXray options?*

Compared to Paper Anti-XRay and Orebfuscator:
- MinerTrack is lightweight.
- MinerTrack's engine is innovative.
- MinerTrack detects Xray users, leaving it to you to decide on sanctions.

Compared to other AntiXray solutions:
- MinerTrack supports the latest Minecraft version.
- MinerTrack has been tested on servers with about 20 simultaneous players, with very few false positives (*default config*).
- MinerTrack is free.
